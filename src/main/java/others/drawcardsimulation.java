// Model 2 (M2):

// P(AB) = P(both are titanic and he plays one of them) = 1/7 * 1/7 = 1/49
// P(B) = P(at least one of card is titanic and he just happened to play the titanic) = P(he plays a random card which just happened to be titanic)  (associative law)  = ½ * 1/7 + ½ * 1/7   = 1/7
// P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(B) = 1/7

// Challenge Question 2 under M2:
// What if player1 never play the card but you just know that one of it is titanic:

// P(AB) = P(both are titanic and he plays one of them) = 1/7 * 1/7 = 1/49
// P(B) = P(at least one of card is titanic) = 1 - 6/7*6/7 = 13/49
// P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(B) = 1/13
